### 3. Correlative Conjunctions
Correlative conjunctions are pairs of conjunctions that work together to join words, phrases, or clauses. Common pairs include: both...and, either...or, neither...nor, not only...but also, whether...or.

**Examples:**

   - He will either call or send a message.
   - They can either go to the beach or the mountains.
   - Either you apologize, or I will leave.

3. **Neither...nor**: Indicates that neither of the two options is true.
   - Neither John nor Mary is coming to the party.
   - She neither called nor sent a message.
   - He neither smokes nor drinks.
   - They neither confirmed nor denied the rumor.
   - Neither the teacher nor the students were present.

4. **Not only...but also**: Emphasizes that both elements are true.
   - She is not only intelligent but also hardworking.
   - He not only sings but also dances.

The semicolon (`;`) is used in English for a few specific purposes:  

### 1. **Connecting Independent Clauses (Without a Conjunction)**  
A semicolon is used to join two related independent clauses that could stand as separate sentences but are closely connected in meaning.  
**Example:**  
âœ… *I wanted to go for a walk; the weather was too cold.*  
(Instead of: "I wanted to go for a walk. The weather was too cold.")  

### 2. **Before Conjunctive Adverbs**  
When using words like *however, therefore, moreover, consequently*, etc., to connect two independent clauses, a semicolon is placed before the conjunctive adverb, and a comma follows it.  
**Example:**  
âœ… *She studied hard; however, she didn't pass the exam.*  

### 3. **Separating Items in a List (When Items Have Commas)**  
If items in a list contain commas, a semicolon is used to avoid confusion.  
**Example:**  
âœ… *We traveled to Paris, France; Rome, Italy; and Madrid, Spain.*
